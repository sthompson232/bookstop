This project was created to include new technologies that I have been wanting to learn in order to create a fully complete and modern ecommerce/blog website.

These technologies include:
- Secure token authentication across multiple devices with django-rest-knox
- Celery, Celery beat and Redis
- SWR
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- React hook forms
- Quill.js or another WYSIWYG editor.
- Stripe API
- Potentially Redux toolkit if needed
